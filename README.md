# Flight_price_prediction

This project is focused on predicting flight prices using a dataset from Kaggle. The primary goal is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the prices of flights based on various features.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle. It includes the following features:
- airline: Name of the airline
- flight: Flight number
- source_city: City from which the flight departs
- departure_time: Time of departure
- stops: Number of stops
- arrival_time: Time of arrival
- destination_city: City where the flight lands
- class: Travel class (Economy, Business)
- duration: Duration of the flight
- days_left: Number of days left for the flight
- price: Price of the flight

## Evaluation
Evaluate the performance of the trained model using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
